We speculated that if any common respiratory pathogen, such as influenza and parainfluenza viruses, RSV, ADV, MP and CP, or the previous emerging novel coronaviruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, was isolated from body fluids and secretions of the infected patients, related treatment and management could have been implemented in the first place
In the S protein of the SARS-CoV, a small domain containing residues 306-575 was identified to be the receptor binding domain (RBD), in which residues 424-494 known as the receptor binding motif (RBM) directly mediate the interaction with ACE2
Phylogenetic studies have shown that 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV belong to the subgenus Sarbecovirus, but they are distantly related 5-8 , with a sequence identity of 79.6% at the whole-genome level 5
However, SARS-CoV, using the same receptor, was not detected in skeletal muscle by post-mortem examination
In conclusion, SARS-Cov is the closest related virus to 2019-nCoV for which a significant number of epitopes has been defined in humans (and other species), and that also causes human disease with lethal outcomes
The confirmation delay does not affect the infecting process, but brings a direct hinder in inspecting the real number of confirmed cases
MSIR model predicts a earlier and higher infectious peak position than MSEIR model
Consistent with a role of DUSP1 in the dephosphorylation of JNK and p38, we observed a marked increase of JNK and p38 phosphorylation in the absence of DUSP1 during SeV and RSV infection
Phage-mediated horizontal gene transfer events are responsible for the spread of novel functions including the development of pathogenicity in bacterial strains such as Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, Streptococcus pyogenes and many Staphylococcus aureus strains
The sequence identity between the 3CL proteases of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV is 96.08%
Taken together with our receptor assay results, it may be possible that 2019-nCoV arose from recombination between clade 1 and the other clades
In contrast, concentrated sugar is relative rare in wild niches and competition for it is fierce, with concentrations unlikely to often exceed the 0.5% threshold at which sugar fermentation kicks in
Killer toxin encoded by pGKL plasmids is translated by the cap-independent pathway
Comparing with SARS-CoV and MERS, 2019-nCoV seems to be more readily transmitted from human to human, spreading to multiple countries and regions and leading to the WHO declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern
SARS-CoV was previously shown to depend on both extracellular and intracellular Ca 2+ pools for successful infection, and it is believed that this dependency is due to Ca 2+ interactions with the SARS-CoV FP
Regarding the respiratory hygiene measures, facemask wearing is considered as one of the most cost-effective and important measures to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, but it became a social concern due to the recent global facemask shortage
Our study also shows that the activation of the interferon-MAPK signaling pathway and TCR-and BCRproduced antibodies play key roles in combating SARS-CoV-2 infection
It is widespread opinion in the scientific community that current official data on the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2, responsible of the correlated disease, COIVD-19, among population, are likely to suffer from a strong downward bias
